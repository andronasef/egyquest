![Egyquest - Discover Egypt](public/egyquest-social.jpg)

Embark on an immersive journey to ancient Egypt from the comfort of your home with [Egyquest](https://andronasef.github.io/egyquest). This web application allows you to explore the wonders of this legendary civilization through a virtual tour of its most famous landmarks, including the majestic pyramids and mystical temples.

## Idea üí°

What I was thinking is to make a directory of Egypt places and display some images and facts to every place but Thanks to [@nealagarwal](https://twitter.com/nealagarwal) to I came up with the idea (of make it all about Google Street View) for my website after being inspired by [Neal.Fun's](https://neal.fun/) tool, [Wonders of Google Street](https://neal.fun/wonders-of-street-view/).

## How to use ? ü§î

To use Egyquest, simply navigate to the [website](https://andronasef.github.io/egyquest) and start exploring! No sign-up or login is required.

## Technologies üíª

### Frontend

- React
- Redux
- Tailwind
- Float UI

### Backend

- Google Script + Google Sheets

How!? => I created a straightforward API using Google Script, which retrieves data from Google Sheets and produces a JSON response containing information about each location.
